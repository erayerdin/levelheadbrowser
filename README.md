An Android application to browse levels, profiles, daily build levels and tower trial levels etc.

Currently, the application is in preview stage. [There is a devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ChYHl8gdE&list=PLbJe7nxsM6nXbQnq1gq8DCw878A6FA-zb) **in Turkish** if you are interested.

You can also run it on desktop (tested on Linux only).
